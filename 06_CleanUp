# This dataset is fun to experiment with, but once you are done, you can delete everything with the following:
MATCH (n:Person|Movie)
DETACH DELETE n

# You can verify that there is nothing left by a simple query:
MATCH ()
RETURN count (*)

# Delete all nodes and rels in db
MATCH (n)
DETACH DELETE n
